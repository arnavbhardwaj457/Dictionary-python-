# Dictionary-python-
This python code implements a dictionary-like translation tool that takes user input and attempts to match the word with entries from a dataset (data.json). If an exact match isn't found, it suggests the closest match using difflib.get_close_matches. If you'd like, I can help refine or test the code for any specific use case.
